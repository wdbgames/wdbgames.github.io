  {
    "question": "Can [game] be added?",
    "answer": "A simple way to find this out is by looking up what programming language [game] was coded in. If it is unity, unreal engine, game maker, godot, or javascript it probably will work. If it is c, c++, or java it probably won't work."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will anything that isn't a game or doesn't have to do with the website be added?",
    "answer": "No, unless it's relevant in some way."
  },
  {
    "question": "What games might be added soon?",
    "answer": "PVZ, more strategy and puzzle games, maybe Eaglercraft..."
  },
  {
    "question": "When do you check suggestions?",
    "answer": "Suggestions will always be read at some point and considered, even if it takes a month to do so."
  },
  {
    "question": "The website is broken!",
    "answer": "This website is checked regularly even if it's not being actively updated. However, almost everything should be working right now. Submit a suggestion if the website is broken."
  },
  {
    "question": "The website isn't loading!",
    "answer": "Because of a recent site overhaul relaunching this site is extremely easy. You can even fork the GitHub repo yourself and make your own website based off this one."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why can't [game] be added? It's possible to add!",
    "answer": "Maybe it's possible, but either it runs extremely slowly in a browser, is multiplayer, or it is impractical to host. Any multiplayer games will not be added due to server costs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much of this site is vibecoded?",
    "answer": "This is an interesting question that's only been asked twice. About half this site is vibecoded, which makes sense since it was started quite a while ago. Vibecoding isn't necessarily bad with javascript because much of the sheer amount of web scraping done by major AI companies, but a future milestone would be to un-vibecode and review parts of this website."

  {
    "question": "I hacked the firebase database!",
    "answer": "Not anymore (hopefully). Give me your email in the suggestions form if you still want to talk..."
