    "question": "Can you add [game]?",
    "answer": "A simple way to find this out is by looking up what programming language [game] was coded in. If it is unity, unreal engine, game maker, godot, or javascript it probably will work. If it is c, c++, or java it probably won't work."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will you add anything that isn't a game or doesn't have to do with the website?",
    "answer": "No, unless it's relevant in some way."
  },
  {
    "question": "What games might be added soon?",
    "answer": "10 Minutes Till Dawn, Google Doodle Baseball, 2 Player Slope, N-Gon, PvZ, and Sandspiel. Maybe Deltarune."
  },
  {
    "question": "When do you check suggestions?",
    "answer": "Suggestions will always be read at some point and considered, even if it takes a month to do so."

  {
    "question": "Your website is broken!",
    "answer": "This website is checked regularly even if it's not being actively updated. However, almost everything should be working right now."
  },
  {
    "question": "Your website isn't loading!",
    "answer": "Because of a recent site overhaul relaunching this site is extremely easy. You can even fork the GitHub repo yourself and make your own website based off this one."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why won't you add [game]? It's technically possible!",
    "answer": "Maybe it's possible, but either it runs extremely slowly in a browser, is multiplayer, or it is impractical to host. Any multiplayer games will not be added due to server costs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Hehehehe I hacked your firebase database!",
    "answer": "Wow, you hacked this website. Amazing. GitHub pages sites are very finicky with firebases' auth, so this will likely never be fixed unless someone makes a pull request."
